=[[https://github.com/0x0584/scmin][scmin]]= or minimal Scheme[fn:1] interpreter, is a basic programming environment for the /Scheme Programming Language/ that I had written way back in the summer of 2018. I was trying to learn & make something interesting since I was bored, so I thought that learning some functional programming might be helpful[fn:2]. And It turns out that building your own functional programming language interpreter is an elegant way to do so!

Now, what's more fascinating, is that previously I had used C, which did many things well, but on the other hand, it is too primitive and I wasn't planing to make something that would require such a low level, so doing many things manually equals more code to maintain, thus this repo. I have decided to rebuild the interpreter from scratch using C++ ---  a /modern/ language provides a whole lot to build something solid and robust, rather than re inventing the wheel.

* is it Scheme or Lisp?

Well, about similarities, they're both of the same programming paradigm, both belong are functional[fn:3] languages, yet they differ on an implementation[fn:4] level.
